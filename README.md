Demo SCSCP server for mitm

You should have the IO, OpenMath and SCSCP packages installed.
Note that the IO package requires compilation.

To run SCSCP server:
* Change to the `gap` directory
* Read `mitm_server` into GAP

To check the GAP client:
* Start GAP in the same directory where this `README.md` file is located
* Copy and paste commands from `demo.g`

The GAP client will connect to the server running at localhost.
Adjust the server address if required.
